# TopMod #

**TopMod** is based on a new paradigm that allows dynamically changing the topology of 2-manifold polygonal meshes. The new paradigm always guarantees topological consistency of polygonal meshes.

Based on our paradigm, by simply adding and deleting edges,handles can be created and deleted, holes can be opened or closed, polygonal meshes can be connected or disconnected. These edge insertion and edge deletion operations are highly consistent with subdivision algorithms. In particular, these operations can easily be included into a subdivision modeling system such that the topological changes and subdivision operations can be performed alternatively during model construction.

TopMod demonstrates practical examples of topology changes based on this new paradigm and show that the new paradigm is convenient, effective, efficient, and friendly to subdivision surfaces.
